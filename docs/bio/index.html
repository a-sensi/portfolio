          <p>Alex Sensiba is an artist that participates in the creation of visual narratives. A fantasy devotee, they utilize comics, paint, and animation to bring to life characters, creatures, and the worlds that they exist in. In all their works, they explore the idea of layering—
            Inviting viewers to explore her work and imagine stories of their own through the layering of color, details, and themes. Alex enjoys the complexity of lived-in spaces and the spirit a place may hold, haunted or not. Captivated by the ideas of ‘home’ as both a place and a feeling; they are inspired greatly by the visual decoration of children’s books and medieval tapestries. She is intrigued by nature and exploring alternate perspectives, often with a focus on the fauna and flora that fills the environment. </p>
            
           <p> Thrilled by the supernatural and its connections to queer identity, they focus on the creation of work that is both complex and diverse with familiar ties to fairytales of the past. Alex is interested in creating work to celebrate joy, strength, and wonder. </p>
            
           <p> Alex Sensiba is currently located in Chicago, IL, and is pursuing a BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
